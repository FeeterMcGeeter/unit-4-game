# Crystals Collector

### Description
Crystals Collector is a game of memory and basic math skills.  When the page is loaded, a number is randomly generated (between 19 and 120) and displayed for the user.  A randomly generated number (between 1 and 12) will also be associated with each of the four crystals shown.  The goal is to match your total with the number provided by clicking on the crystals.  The value of each crystal will not be displayed, so the user will have to memorize what each value is when adding to their total.  If the user's total goes over the number shown, the game is lost!  Good Luck!!!

### Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3

* Javascript

Added audio to each crystal when clicked along with victory and loss audio when game has been completed.
